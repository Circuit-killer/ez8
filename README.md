## The easy 8-bit processor architecture

This is an attempt to craft an 8-bit microcontroller architecture that is
easy to implement. Care is taken to choose the instruction encoding so that
instructions that perform similar tasks have similar encodings.

This repository contains an assembler written in OCaml, an emulator written in
C, and some test assembly programs. Work is underway on an FPGA hardware
implementation and detailed ISA docs.
